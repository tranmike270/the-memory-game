# The Memory Game

This is a simple game that test your memorization abilities! The objective of the game is to click all of the character images without clicking the same one twice in a round. The round continues until you click an image you've already clicked on the current round, OR until successfully click all the images without selecting the same one twice. There are 25 images (anime characters...of course..it's me who made it..). Each image will give you one point, and selecting the same image will reset your points to 0. If you win and complete the round, your points will not reset. (Yes... you can get more than 25 points) There is also a high-score displayed as well!
